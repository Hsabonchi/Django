#### Creating a project
  - cd into a directory where you’d like to store your code, then
  - run  django-admin startproject `mysite`.
  - This will create a `mysite` directory in your current directory

  - Let’s verify your Django project works. Change into the outer mysite directory, if you haven’t already,
  -  and run the following commands
    -   python manage.py runserver
    -   By default, the runserver command starts the development server on the internal IP at port 8000.


  -   To create your app, make sure you’re in the same directory as manage.py and type this command:
    -   python manage.py startapp polls 

- Installation
 -   Python
 -   virtualenv
